MrBrie: Welcome to Kordo Village. If you're new then you must have seen our boys on the way into town.
MrBrie: We are so proud of them. My father... bless his cheesy heart, would be so proud of them. 
MrBrie: We are the Brie family, descended from Nibbles Brie himself, before he was eviscerated in a misunderstanding with a cat, that is. 
MrBrie: Bao you say your name is. 
MrBrie: Well the Brie's are famous for hospitality so stop by any time chap.
